# 🛍️ Mall Customer EDA (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of mall customers to understand their demographic details and spending behavior.  
The goal is to extract meaningful insights using **Python data analysis and visualization techniques** that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

This is a **beginner-friendly yet interview-ready project**, focusing on clear analysis rather than complex machine learning models.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Gender Distribution
- The dataset shows a **fairly balanced distribution** of male and female customers.
- This helps ensure unbiased analysis across genders.

### 2️⃣ Age Distribution
- Most customers fall between **20 to 40 years**, indicating a younger customer base.
- Fewer customers belong to higher age groups.

### 3️⃣ Annual Income Distribution
- Annual income ranges widely, from low to high income groups.
- Majority of customers lie in the **mid-income range**, making it a key segment for business strategies.

### 4️⃣ Spending Score Distribution
- Spending scores are spread across the full range (1–100).
- This indicates **diverse purchasing behavior** among customers.

## 📈 Bivariate Analysis (Key Visualizations)

### 🔹 Age vs Spending Score
- Younger customers tend to have **higher spending scores**.
- As age increases, spending behavior becomes more moderate and scattered.
- Both genders show similar spending patterns across age groups.

### 🔹 Annual Income vs Spending Score
- High income does not always mean high spending.
- Customers with **moderate income show a wide range of spending behavior**.
- This highlights that spending is influenced by factors beyond income alone.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Spending behavior is **not directly proportional** to income.
- Younger customers are more likely to have higher spending scores.
- Gender does not significantly affect spending patterns.
- Customer behavior is diverse, making segmentation important for targeted marketing.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Exploratory Data Analysis** can uncover valuable customer insights without using complex machine learning techniques.  
The analysis helps businesses understand customer behavior and design better marketing and engagement strategies.
